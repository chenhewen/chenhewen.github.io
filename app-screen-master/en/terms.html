        <p>Thank you for using the "App Screen Master" application (hereinafter referred to as "this app" or "the app")! This agreement is a legally binding contract between you and the app developer. It is important to understand the services we provide and our expectations of you before using this service. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the following terms of this agreement. Unless you accept all the terms of this agreement, you are not authorized to use the services provided by the app. Your registration, login, and use of the app will be deemed as acceptance of this agreement and agreement to be bound by its terms. This agreement can be viewed on this website at any time and will be updated without further notice. If you no longer accept the modified terms after an update, please stop using the app immediately.</p>

        <h3>1. Service Content</h3>
        <p>1. This software offers convenience for creating application screenshots, providing features like background customization, device adjustments, adding or removing text, and other user-friendly operations, significantly reducing the time required for generating screenshots.</p>

        <p>2. This software will continuously add new features and may remove certain features, as well as increase or decrease service restrictions.</p>

        <p>3. This software may have bugs, and in order to improve user experience and ensure service security, we may update our software. It is recommended that you accept the updated version; otherwise, you may not be able to use our services properly.</p>

        <p>4. In order to protect the software from misuse, the developer has the right to prohibit destructive usage, including but not limited to disabling user services.</p>


        <h3>2. Warranty and Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>1. Disclaimer regarding third-party actions: If you suffer any losses resulting from the use of this service caused by services and resources provided by third parties other than us, you can only seek compensation from the respective third party. We will assist to the best of our ability but do not assume any responsibility in this regard.</p>

        <p>2. This software promises not to collect or view user-created images unless explicitly shared with us by the user. However, since the third-party service's actions of saving, processing, and altering images are beyond the control of this software, we do not bear joint liability for any image information leaks caused by the third-party service.</p>

        <p>3. Some sub-services of this service may come from other third-party partners, and the availability of such content may be canceled due to the termination of cooperation agreements between us and third-party partners. You are aware of this uncertainty. Once such sub-services are canceled due to the termination of cooperation agreements between us and third-party partners, if the sub-service was provided to you free of charge, you will no longer be able to continue using that sub-service. If you have paid for the sub-service, we will do our best to negotiate with the third party. If the third party agrees, you can continue using the sub-service until the paid amount is exhausted. If the third party does not agree to your continued use of the sub-service, we will deduct a certain proportion of the service fee based on your actual usage and refund the remaining amount to you.</p>

        <h3>3. User Risk Acceptance</h3>
        <p>1. Users need to understand that due to business development needs, this app may unilaterally make changes, suspend, or terminate part or all of the services provided.</p>

        <p>2. In the event of app termination, users will be notified in advance, and any losses incurred by paid users will be compensated according to the compensation principles of the Apple platform.</p>

        <p>3. As the software is a tool, we are not aware of users' personal use of images that do not comply with legal regulations. Therefore, we do not assume any associated responsibility. Users are responsible for such actions. You may not use the software to distribute any content that harms the country or spreads obscenity or pornography.</p>

        <h3>4. Intellectual Property Statement</h3>
        <p>All code, images, and derivative works provided by this software belong to the developer and are protected by intellectual property laws. Without the written consent of the developer, you are not permitted to crack the software or distribute the app again.</p>
