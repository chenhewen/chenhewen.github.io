        <p>Thank you for using "LightPic". If you subscribe to the "Professional Edition" of "LightPic" for automatic renewal, it means you are a "Professional Edition" member of "LightPic".</p>

        <p>Currently, automatic renewal subscription offers three options: monthly automatic renewal, quarterly automatic renewal, and annual automatic renewal. Any of these options will make you a "Professional Edition" member.</p>

        <p>The subscription price of this software may vary in different regions, and the specific price will be displayed within the application and the app distribution platform. The subscription fee will be deducted from the credit card linked to your iCloud (iTunes) account. The Apple iCloud (iTunes) account will charge you within 24 hours before expiration, and after a successful payment, the subscription period will be extended for one subscription cycle. To cancel the renewal, please manually disable the auto-renewal function in the iCloud (iTunes)/Apple ID settings management before 24 hours prior to the expiration of the current subscription period. During the trial period, if the iTunes account does not cancel the subscription, it will be automatically activated and charged at the end of the trial period. Unused trial duration will become invalid after purchasing the subscription. It is your choice to cancel this service. If you choose not to cancel, the renewal service for the next billing cycle will be activated for you.</p>

        <p>If you have already purchased the Professional Edition and are within the subscription period, but the membership corresponding to your iCloud (iTunes) account is not active due to device replacement or other reasons, please try clicking "Restore Purchase," wait patiently, or restart the application.</p>

        <p>If you have made a payment but cannot restore or use the service, please email: 532531210@qq.com</p>
